# ghost-github

Storage on GitHub for Ghost. Good for blogs hosted on platforms without a persistent filesystem (e.g. [Heroku](https://heroku.com)).

## Fork is about versions upgrade

...and using only oauth token.

## Installation

```
cd /path/to/your/ghost/installation
npm install ghost-github
mkdir content/storage
cp -r node_modules/ghost-github content/storage/ghost-github
```

## Usage

Add the following to your configuration file depending on the version of Ghost you have. Replace values accordingly.

```js
storage: {
    active: "ghost-github",
    "ghost-github": {
        // Required: Can either be basic, oauth, or token
        type: "oauth",
        // Either: Personal access token (for token and oauth)
        token: "[my token here]",
        // Required: Name of repo you want to save files to
        repo: "ghost-on-heroku",
        // Optional: Will save to branch of repo, defaults to master
        branch: "gh-pages",
        // Optional: Will place the image in the specified directory rather than root
        destination: "",
        // Optional: Will use base URL for image requests
        baseUrl: "https://cdn.example.com"
    }
}
```

## Questions

### How do I get a personal access token?

1. Create a new personal token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).
2. Select 'repo' (which will select everything under `repo`), as **ghost-github** will need access to your repository.
3. Copy the token that shows up upon successful creation, and paste that into the `token` field of **ghost-github**'s configuration.

### I'm getting a "Bad credentials" error. What should I do?

Your token or password might be incorrect. You should double-check your configuration.

### I'm getting a "Not found" error. What should I do?

Make sure the repository you specified exists. Also, check to make sure the branch (if specified) exists in the repo.
